To achieve this I have used FourSquare API through the venues channel. I used the \"near\" query to get venues (in our case, Hospitals) in each city. To specify which venue type I want, I have set the \"CategoryID\" to point to Hospitals.\n\n\nI have set the query limit to 100, to reduce query request frequency to the available celing. This would give me a list of 100 Hospitals present in each of the 6 cities. I saved the name and coordinate data from the result and plotted them on the map for visual inspection.\n\nTo get an optimum location for the dedicated COVID-19 control room, I have calculated a center coordinate of all the hospitals in the city to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Then I calculated the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates. That was my indicator; mean distance to the mean coordinate. As I believe that since the control room will be monitoring COVID-19 situation in each hospital, it should be in a central location to all hospitals present in the ciy."

In General statistics we can ignore such outliers, but in our case its not just a spot on a map, its a hospital with real patients that may require urgent medical attention. \n\nTo solve that, one consideration to do further work on is to divide all the hospitals into zonal clusters and assign a zonal COVID-19 control room for each cluster headed by a central COVID-19 control room as suggested by our current analysis."
